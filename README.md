# Upgrades-brownie

In this project, I understood how we can upgrade smart contracts even though technically they are immutable.
I learnt how proxies work and about the openzeppeling ProxyAdmin contract and TransparentUpgradeableProxy contract which helps in accomplishing upgrades. 
I also wrote tests to check if the upgrade actually works. The smart contracts are very simple with just a store and retrieve function for the value and the upradaeble contract having an additional increment function.
